Metadata-Version: 1.0
Name: nb-dep-ud-sm
Version: 0.0.1
Summary: Based on data from:
  https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Norwegian-Bokmaal

  And updated norwegian language package from this pull request:
  https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/1882

  Trained using no_bokmaal-ud-train.conllu and no_bokmaal-ud-dev.conllu

  With hyperparameters:
  batch_from=16 batch_to=64 spacy train nb ... etc...

  So its probably room for improvement. I would also like to improve the
  lemmatizer and othe language features.
